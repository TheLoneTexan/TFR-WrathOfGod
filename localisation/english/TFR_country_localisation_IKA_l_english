 IKA_shall_we_gather: "Shall We Gather at the River?"
 IKA_shall_we_gather_desc: "Thanks to our recent resurgence, we have seen a large influx of recruits drawn from true-born Christians who have come here to serve us in this holy war. These recruits have formed cliques of their own within the Army, each with differing aims for creating a godly society. Some call for the Millennial Dawn, others seek to reaffirm the principle of One Nation Under God, and still others wish to bring about the Second Coming. Even if these cliques agree with us on the same goal, they are not entirely on the same page either. Such divides must be resolved quickly to preserve our unity and not just reforge America under our vision, but to overcome the influence of Satan and the Antichrist."
 IKA_leaderless_resistance_dynamic: "Leaderless Resistance"
 IKA_leaderless_resistance_dynamic_desc: "Since our organization came into existence in 1982, we have fought a war from the shadows against the ungodly and satanic federal government through a series of attacks on its most cherished institutions like the baby-murdering abortion clinics, using an effective model of warfare known as “leaderless resistance” wherein affiliated cells operate under our official backing without a central structure or leader to evade the authorities' grasp and fulfill God's mission.\n\nWith the government's power structures in complete collapse, our faithful cells and holy militias have emerged to take up arms to contribute to the cause in the national struggle. However, the current model is no longer needed as this war is now being fought on the blood-stained battlefields, and we must centralize our command to meet the challenges ahead of us as Christian soldiers."
 IKA_backwoods_economy_dynamic: "Backwoods Economy"
 IKA_backwoods_economy_dynamic_desc: "It is no secret that the Appalachians are a region where industry has been in decline, with its coal mines and manufacturing businesses going bankrupt and closing, as well as significant levels of poverty found among the populace, exacerbated further by the shortages in food or medicine caused by the Oil Crisis and the Second American Civil War. This economic decline threatens to impede the Army of God's war effort and its ability to produce enough equipment and supplies to sustain its forces in the long run. Thus, a revitalization and expansion of local industry in America's backwoods is necessary for the AOG to wage war and defeat its rivals."
