 #Starting National Spirits
 IKA_shall_we_gather: "Shall We Gather at the River?"
 IKA_shall_we_gather_desc: "Thanks to our recent resurgence, we have seen a large influx of recruits drawn from true-born Christians who have come here to serve us in this holy war. These recruits have formed cliques of their own within the Army, each with differing aims for creating a godly society. Some call for the Millennial Dawn, others seek to reaffirm the principle of One Nation Under God, and still others wish to bring about the Second Coming. Even if these cliques agree with us on the same goal, they are not entirely on the same page either. Such divides must be resolved quickly to preserve our unity and not just reforge America under our vision, but to overcome the influence of Satan and the Antichrist."
 IKA_leaderless_resistance_dynamic: "Leaderless Resistance"
 IKA_leaderless_resistance_dynamic_desc: "Since our organization came into existence in 1982, we have fought a war from the shadows against the ungodly and satanic federal government through a series of attacks on its most cherished institutions like the baby-murdering abortion clinics, using an effective model of warfare known as “leaderless resistance” wherein affiliated cells operate under our official backing without a central structure or leader to evade the authorities' grasp and fulfill God's mission.\n\nWith the government's power structures in complete collapse, our faithful cells and holy militias have emerged to take up arms to contribute to the cause in the national struggle. However, the current model is no longer needed as this war is now being fought on the blood-stained battlefields, and we must centralize our command to meet the challenges ahead of us as Christian soldiers."
 IKA_backwoods_economy_dynamic: "Backwoods Economy"
 IKA_backwoods_economy_dynamic_desc: "It is no secret that the Appalachians are a region where industry has been in decline, with its coal mines and manufacturing businesses going bankrupt and closing, as well as significant levels of poverty found among the populace, exacerbated further by the shortages in food or medicine caused by the Oil Crisis and the Second American Civil War. This economic decline threatens to impede the Army of God's war effort and its ability to produce enough equipment and supplies to sustain its forces in the long run. Thus, a revitalization and expansion of local industry in America's backwoods is necessary for the AOG to wage war and defeat its rivals."

 #Events
 IKA.1.t: "Asheville Revival"
 IKA.1.d: "Asheville may have once been a rather liberal city that agreed to give reparations to its African-American population after the death of Quinton Evans. However, that all changed when the Army of God entered town at the beginning of the Second American Civil War. Matt Shea, the devout former Washington State House Representative, wore a military uniform as he led his regiment of soldiers into the city. As Shea led the military to guard the Cathedral of All Souls, the other members of the Army of God came forward.\n\nFirst came Donald Spitz, an ordained Pentecostal minister who served as the Army of God's spokesperson and webmaster. Behind him was the infamous Steven Anderson, founder of the Faithful Word Baptist Church, with a look that could kill. Spitz took to the pulpit set up for him and looked into the microphone. He never thought he would get to this point. But God worked in mysterious ways.\n\n"Christians of Asheville, you have been liberated!" Spitz announced as the flag of the Army of God was unfurled behind him. He slammed his Bible on the pulpit and shouted, "The Whore of Babylon has fallen! Satan's greatest asset is in retreat before our Crusade! As you can see, the homosexuals, abortionists and godless atheists are scurrying away like the vermin they are! Like Sodom and Gomorrah before, God has destroyed the wicked America for its baby-killing, sodomy and greed! The long-awaited Millennium is at hand and this is where we show our faith! We must not be like Judas, who betrayed our Lord, Jesus Christ! Any so-called 'Christian' who fights against us is not a follower of God, but rather an unbeliever and servant of Satan and the Antichrist!""
 IKA.1.a: "The holy war has begun"
 IKA.2.t: "Guardians of the Faith"
 IKA.2.d: "It is an undeniable truth that there are traitors and would-be rebels among us. They threaten to undermine our cause from within by spreading false dogmas to the American people in the hopes of toppling us. For this reason, a permanent solution is needed to combat these problems.\n\nThe solution in question comes in the form of a specialized agency known as the Guardians of the Faith or the GOF for short. The Guardians of the Faith will not just provide security and stability, but also uphold the teachings of God and Jesus Christ, specifically the Bible and the Ten Commandments. It is what some will call a "religious police" in the vein of Islamic police agencies found in Afghanistan, Iran and, before the civil war, Saudi Arabia. Regardless of such comparisons, the Guardians are our eyes and ears into the hearts and minds of the populace.\n\nThe Guardians of the Faith will serve as an essential component of the new godly society in the fight against Satan by bringing sinners to justice and protecting true-born Christians from further harm. These sinners include abortionists, advocates of the homosexual agenda, "progressive Christians," feminists, leftists and other radicals. And it is the duty of every true-born Christian to expose them on behalf of the Guardians.\n\nEvery town and city across America shall have a Guardian on standby, making sure that every sinner will be punished and met with the full fury of God."
 IKA.2.a: "For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver and the Lord is our King!"
 IKA.3.t: "The Conversion Camps"
 IKA.3.d: "Conversion therapy. Conversion therapy is a medical practice that seeks to change the sexual orientation or gender of an individual to be more in line with their true identity created in God's image through various methods. Historically speaking, conversion therapy has been used by Christians and even some non-Christians to root out the poisonous diseases of homosexuality and gender ideology. It was considered by many to be a legitimate practice in the world of medicine.\n\nUnfortunately, so-called "LGBT rights" organizations and liberals would be responsible for stamping out conversion therapy by demonizing it and eventually criminalizing it. Up until the start of the civil war, it was banned in entire states and the District of Columbia.\n\nBut with the fall of Babylon, we now have the opportunity to reintroduce this divine theory to the masses. Hence, we have established conversion camps to punish or re-educate sinners to embrace Christ and reject false creeds such as homosexuality, gender ideology, paganism, and blasphemy. These camps are staffed by enthusiastic volunteers and have our full support. The conversion camps will serve as an instrument of change in bringing God and Jesus Christ back to the American people and to eliminate sin, even if we have to use harsh punishment to achieve results."
 IKA.3.a: "The wicked shall be punished for their transgressions"
 IKA.4.t: "Abortionists Under Attack"
 IKA.4.d: ""On the orders of God and Jesus Christ, you are hereby under arrest for committing prenatal infanticide," declared an officer from the Guardians of the Faith.\n\n"What? How is that infanticide? We're only providing abortions to women who are under stress or in danger," said the executive director of an abortion clinic.\n\nThe executive director and staff of an abortion clinic in a small Southern town were left speechless as they knew what this sentence would mean for them: hard labor and forced conversion into the radical ideology of the Army of God. Like so many others, the executive director and her staff could do nothing but watch as the Guardians of the Faith ransacked the now-shuttered place, searching for any materials worth bringing to their superiors for documentation on pro-abortion activities if they weren't going to burn them anyway. A few tried to interfere in the operation but were quickly incapacitated. The director and the staff of the abortion clinic would be arrested and sent to the conversion camps alongside other abortionists. The clinic would be just one of many abortion facilities shut down by the Guardians of the Faith.\n\nFor the officer and his comrades, they were simply doing the Lord's work by saving the lives of millions of children from being slaughtered in the womb. It was one of many steps in fulfilling the dream of a holy society. The shutdown and eventual destruction of the abortion clinic and the subsequent arrest of its employees were one of the happiest days in their lives, with the providers now sent off to the camps to repent or die.\n\nIn Army-controlled areas, the organization made no secret of its desire to "protect the unborn," with abortion considered to be a particularly depraved crime alongside homosexuality and blasphemy. And as the organization itself was established for the purpose of stopping abortion, it was no surprise that such a law would be enforced. The head officer and other Guardians like him made it clear to any abortionists hiding amongst the public that if they were to continue carrying out such practices, severe consequences would soon follow. Within the Bible Belt, the ideological center of the Army of God, some welcomed such news with sympathy for their cause, while others felt fear and worried about what would come next."
 IKA.4.a: "Abortion is murder. Protect life"
 IKA.5.t: "Sanctification of Atlanta"
 IKA.5.d: "The city of Atlanta is ours! The last remnants of the Reds have finally surrendered and have been sent to conversion camps or eliminated. Atlanta is secure, and the process of sanctification is continuing at a steady pace, so to speak, with all centers of sin destroyed, be they sodomite bars, abortion clinics, and strip clubs, including all traces of the infamous Planned Parenthood and Magic City. In their place are holy establishments and churches to serve our cause.\n\nWith Atlanta in our hands, we can now disseminate our vision to its predominantly Baptist population as a source of recruits and use its well-established media infrastructure to spread the Word of God to the rest of the country. It will not just serve as our base of operations for the holy war but it will be rebuilt into a Christian metropolis led by the faithful, as will other American cities. The fight against Satan is a difficult struggle, but one that will be filled with triumph as we march forward to our divine future."
 IKA.5.a: "A big step towards the return of God to this forsaken land"
 IKA.6.t: "The Second Burning of Atlanta"
 IKA.6.d: "Day 5\n\nWe finally got to the city of Atlanta. The federal remnants and satanic Socialists of Redneck Revolt obviously didn't give it up easily, but 50 dead later, we have it now. The rest of the city has already fallen and is in various states of damage from the fighting.\n\nI saw a couple of Redneck Revolt members trying to flee from a hideout earlier after making a "brave last stand." While my company wasn't the one who dealt with them, I saw the fat one's body strung up on a building on my way back to base. Good riddance. He was one of the social media managers, from what I heard, so knowing that his satanic soul is finally banished from brainwashing American youth is satisfying if nothing else. I haven't been a youth in a long time, but I do what I can.\n\nMy company was one of the only ones still purging the remnants of the enemy forces. The rest of the army has been diverted towards cleansing the city of satanic influence. They're usually tasked with either capturing and executing the worst of humanity (Planned Parenthood employees, sex workers, pro-Federal Democrats and Republicans and the like), converting buildings (like schools and offices) into institutions that serve Christ, or demolishing all reminders of the satanic government or Redneck Revolt.\n\nThe first opinion seems to be the most fun, from what I've heard from some of my friends in other companies, at least for me. I can see their work on the streets from time to time between building-sweeping missions against Satan's collaborators, and it's both great and terrifying. Many of the fat, colored-haired liberal and socialist women were hanged or crucified and left to die in the sweltering sun. The more healthy liberals and socialists were just shot when they tried to flee the wrath of God. From what I heard, homosexuals, female priests, liberal or socialist-leaning pastors, and other false Christians were the most hated targets of the soldiers, and I see why. Atlanta, for all intents and purposes, has undergone a biblical cleansing from us, the faithful believers.\n\nI don't even want to say what happens to them, but it's well deserved. Seeing a Planned Parenthood worker divided into quarters was not something I was expecting to see every day. I remember when my son was in school before the war. He was learning about the Burning of Atlanta during the First American Civil War and how Sherman destroyed Confederate morale for good. I have no particular love for either the Yankees or the empire of slavery, but I can still see that he made the best choice for shattering morale. Many liberals and socialists on social media and elsewhere have compared the actions of my friends to that of a "fascist Sherman," and even if I'm not a direct part of the cleansing, I still feel great about everything our Army has done.\n\nI'll probably be assigned to cleanse another city after clearing out Atlanta. I should probably be grateful that I even have a working body that can serve Christ, but I still have dreams. God knows what's best for me in the end after all, and I trust Him."
 IKA.6.a: "Amen"
 IKA.7.t: "The Righteous Victorious"
 IKA.7.d: "By the grace of God, our efforts finally bore fruit. After a series of successful offensives, the Southeast is now under the banner of the Lord and Christ. The demonic forces of sin were vanquished, and we have complete authority over these lands. Soon, the rest of America will be reclaimed.\n\nSince our inception, the Army of God's holy mission has always been about avenging the millions of unborn children murdered through state-mandated abortion in order to root out Satan's influence. We are growing stronger day by day, with more faithful churches joining us and every demonic center destroyed. But most importantly, we can finally organize a new godly society built upon the principles of Christianity and further consolidate our forces against our adversaries elsewhere. There is more to come in the following months as the foundations for the godly society are established."
 IKA.7.a: "Let us usher in the moral and spiritual rebirth of America!"
